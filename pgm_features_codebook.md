## Long description
ttime_ is an estimate of the travel time to the nearest major city, derived from a global high-resolution raster map of accessibility developed for the EU. The original indicator is a result of network analysis using a combination of several sources, most collected between 1990 and 2005. The original pixel value is the estimated travel time in minutes by land transportation from the pixel to the nearest major city with more than 50 000 inhabitants. ttime_mean gives the average travel time within each cell.

Agriculture, forestry, and fishing corresponds to ISIC divisions 01-03 and includes forestry, hunting, and fishing, as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. The origin of value added is determined by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), revision 4. Data are in constant 2015 prices, expressed in U.S. dollars
